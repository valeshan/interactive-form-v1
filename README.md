Interactive form is a simple JavaScript application, using JQuery, that handles expected user input and shows user errors when incomplete or incorrect information is supplied. The form is for a fictional FullStack conference and takes in different sorts of information in a simple layout.

No need to install anything, just visit https://valeshan.github.io/interactive-form-v1/ to see it in action.
